# State_of_the_art_tacotron2_model_reproduction
This is my master project.

Using Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning techs(LSTM, Attention Machine, RNN) to rebuild the model of Tacotron2, which is used to transform Text data to Aduio data with human-like voice.

The whole traning time is about 1 month to achieve a practical using of voice model.So make sure the computing resources is valid enough to run these code.
